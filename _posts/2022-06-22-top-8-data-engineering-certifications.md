title: Top 8 Data Engineering certifications to find a job
---

My name is Taras Kloba, and I am a Big Data Competence Manager at
SoftServe. Our recruiters regularly review the lists of newly certified
professionals to find new potential candidates. There is no doubt that
other large companies also use this approach. Thus, I have decided to
prepare a list of in-demand certifications for 2022 that may help you
get a job in the field of Data Engineering.

Let\'s consider the main advantages of hiring certified specialists from
the perspective of service companies:

-   In most cases, customers of service companies do not require
    additional interviews when dealing with certified engineers as they
    trust professional certification.

-   IT companies that hire a certain number of certified employees have
    the opportunity to form a partnership with such giants as GCP,
    Microsoft Azure, and AWS.

-   A certified specialist who has a reasonable theoretical basis in
    combination with an appropriate working environment will be able to
    implement a project by applying best practices and market standards.

However, it is essential to remember that professional certification is
not a \"silver bullet\" that guarantees being hired as soon as you have
received the appropriate training and a certificate. It is a great
advantage that stands you out from other candidates, but still, there is
a lot of work that remains to be done to gain practical experience.

Most companies are already using cloud services or thinking about future
migration to the cloud. According to an analysis conducted by [Offshore
Technology in 2022](https://www.offshore-technology.com/cloud-in-oil-gas/), service companies include cloud computing skills in
57.5% of vacancies compared to 43% in 2021. Our analysis of Data
Engineering related job descriptions for 2021 and 2022 also shows that
the requirements for knowledge of cloud service providers like AWS,
Azure, and GCP are listed even more frequently.

That\'s why I would recommend you to pay greater attention to the
professional certifications of the most popular cloud providers.

I am a certified specialist in Azure and GCP. Partially thanks to the
certifications, I receive requests from recruiters to consider their
vacancies from time to time. Professional certification will definitely
help you improve your professional skills and show your value to
employers. The demand for such specialists will undoubtedly continue
growing. Let me know if you are interested in finding out which
certificates are most relevant for DW/BI Engineers or Big Data Systems
Engineers, and I will write an article on this topic.
