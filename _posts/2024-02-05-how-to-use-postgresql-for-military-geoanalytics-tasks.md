title: How to use PostgreSQL for (military) geoanalytics tasks 
---

I am [Taras Kloba](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kloba/), Associate
Director, Big Data & Analytics at SoftServe. I am also a co-founder of
the [PostgreSQL Ukraine
Community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/postgresql.ua/) and the
military-tech volunteer [Corvus Intelligence
project](https://corvusintell.com/), which leverages technology to
enhance our country\'s defense capabilities, particularly in
intelligence operations.

Our team won the National Defense Hackathon organized by the National
Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, and we also tackled one of the
[NATO TIDE Hackathon 2023](https://dou.ua/forums/topic/44001/)
challenges in Warsaw. My involvement in various projects and initiatives
has allowed me to gain practical experience in geoanalytics, which I am
to share in this publication.

Geoanalytics is crucial in military affairs, as a significant portion of
military data contains geoattributes. In this article, I will discuss
how to use PostgreSQL to process geospatial data and address common
geoanalytical tasks. The information will cover methods for finding the
nearest objects, distance calculations, and using geospatial indexes to
enhance these processes. We will also explore techniques for determining
a point within a polygon and geospatial aggregation. The goal of this
article is to provide practical examples and tips to enhance working
with geospatial data and contribute to the development of new solutions.

*The materials and data used in the article are open-source and have
been approved by the military representatives.*

## First data source: how to import russian military polygon data into PostgreSQL 

I will need certain datasets to initiate the analysis and showcase
PostgreSQL\'s capabilities in geoanalytics. I decided to start with data
on russian military facilities available on
[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) (OSM). The first step is
to load this data into PostgreSQL, after which we can use tools to
optimize queries and enhance their efficiency.

To import data on russian military objects from OSM, we will use the
[osm2pgsql](https://osm2pgsql.org/) tool. This open-source tool
efficiently transfers data from OSM to PostgreSQL. We will load the
[russia-latest.osm.pbf](http://download.geofabrik.de/russia-latest.osm.pbf)
file (3.4 GB) containing information about points, lines, roads, and
polygons from OSM. After loading, the file will be used to populate the
corresponding tables in PostgreSQL, where we can begin the analysis and
processing of data.

The script we are using includes commands for loading OSM data, creating
a new PostgreSQL database, and importing data using osm2pgsql:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/kloba/5df9d0e76adabeda278c6d5c9cef7828.js"></script>

After executing the script, five main tables will appear in our
database:

-   **osm2pgsql_properties**---stores settings and properties used
    during the data import.
-   **planet_osm_line**---contains linear elements, such as roads and
    rivers.
-   **planet_osm_point**---includes point objects, such as buildings
    (not all buildings are marked as geographic polygons, so we will
    have to come up with something to be devised to work with these
    points).
-   **planet_osm_polygon**---stores polygons representing areas, such as
    military bases.
-   **planet_osm_roads**---stores transportation routes.

To simplify the analysis of military objects, we will create a table
called **military_geometries**. The SQL script will select data from the
**planet_osm_line**, **planet_osm_point**, **planet_osm_polygon**, and
**planet_osm_roads** tables, filtering out military objects. A 100-meter
buffer will be applied to lines, points, and roads using
[ST_Buffer](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Buffer.html). This will also
allow us to create polygons based on points and lines, providing the
ability to analyze, for example, whether a point is within the specified
polygons.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/kloba/882a40179ba66d7d218ab8ef9a306fd7.js"></script>

Executing the provided SQL script will allow us to create a
**military_geometries** table that will contain polygons for 9,252
military objects identified on OSM:

![](/imgs/geoanalytics-postgresql/image1.png)
_Visualization of 9,252 military sites across russia and the temporarily
occupied Autonomous Republic of Crimea using QGIS_

In OSM, as in other open sources, information is subject to change. For
example, from the beginning of 2022, 2,995 military objects in russia
were deleted.

They say, \"Screenshots don\'t burn\", but such deletions often lead to
the [Streisand effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect),
where attempts to hide information only attract more attention. If you
want to delve into the historical data of OSM and help identify such
anomalies, you can use resources like
[GeoFabrik.de](https://download.geofabrik.de/russia.html). Although this
doesn\'t directly relate to our analysis, I want to show how these
deleted objects look on a map, illustrating russian attempts to conceal
essential data.

## Second data source: fire data from NASA satellites

As the next data source, we will utilize information from the [Fire
Information for Resource Management
System](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/find-data/near-real-time/firms/vj114imgtdlnrt)
(FIRMS) developed at the University of Maryland with support from NASA
and the UN in 2007. FIRMS allows real-time monitoring of active fires
worldwide, utilizing data from Aqua and Terra satellites equipped with
MODIS spectroradiometers and VIIRS on S-NPP and NOAA 20 satellites. The
information is updated every three hours and even more frequently for
the United States and Canada.

We will be using FIRMS data to identify fires within the territory of
russian military facilities since 2022.

To download fire data from the FIRMS system, we will employ the
following script, extracting all records of fires in russia from January
1, 2022, to the current date. These data will then be imported into a
new table, **viirs_fire_events**, in the PostgreSQL database.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/kloba/8c64099f4286fd3275b7a9604e5b9128.js"></script>

Therefore, we will populate the **viirs_fire_events** table, which will
contain 1,711,475 records of fires in russia. These fires appear as
follows:

![](/imgs/geoanalytics-postgresql/image3.jpeg)
_Visualization of fires in russia since January 1, 2022 (1,711,475 fires)_

The **viirs_fire_events** table in the PostgreSQL database will be used
to store detailed fire data, with fields for coordinates, satellite
parameters, date and time of acquisition, and other critical metadata. A
new column with a data type of **GEOMETRY(POINT, 4326)** will be
automatically populated based on the data from the **longitude** and
**latitude** columns.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/kloba/14a295808b1173044ef2ace4465fb5f4.js"></script>

Suppose you are interested in working with this data on military objects
and fires, but the described process of extracting datasets seems
time-consuming. In that case, there are exported CSV tables for you. You
can download them via the following links:
[military_geometries](https://storage.googleapis.com/files.sql.ua/csv/military_geometries.csv),
[viirs_fire_events](https://storage.googleapis.com/files.sql.ua/csv/viirs_fire_events.csv).

## Searching for military facilities where fires occurred: points within the polygon

As for now, we have two tables: **military_geometries** and
**viirs_fire_events**. Let\'s try to find those military facilities that
have had fires (since the beginning of 2022) or those that have not yet
ðŸ™‚.

![](/imgs/geoanalytics-postgresql/image4.png)

Let\'s use an SQL query with the
[**ST_Contains**](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Contains.html) function to
identify military objects where fires have been detected from NASA
satellites.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/kloba/49609e30b2b736c4d758c26c11fea068.js"></script>

As you\'ve probably noticed, we\'ve identified 129 military sites that
have experienced fires since the start of 2022. What\'s intriguing is
that, in some cases, these fires seem to have occurred more than once.

![](/imgs/geoanalytics-postgresql/image5.png)
_Military facilities where fires have occurred since the beginning of
2022 (the transparency of the facilities indicates the frequency of the
fire incidents)_

The second aspect you may have noticed is that the specified query took
54 minutes and 15 seconds to execute, which is quite long for such a
straightforward operation. It\'s helpful to use the [EXPLAIN
ANALYZE](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-explain.html)
command to understand the reasons for this duration. This command allows
you to analyze the query execution process, identify potential
bottlenecks, and further optimize the query to improve performance.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/kloba/5865856dae4e0995bcf00967394d2d50.js"></script>

In this case, when using the **Nested Loop Semi Join** operator, we
encountered a complexity of O(n\*m), where n is 9,252 rows in the
**military_geometries** table, and m is 1,711,475 rows in
**viirs_fire_events**. This implies that each row from the first table
is compared with every row from the second table, resulting in a huge
number of operations.

Hence, let\'s discuss how we can speed up the execution of such a query
by utilizing indexes.

## Productivity boost: utilizing indexing in geoanalytics 

PostgreSQL is renowned for its scalability features, offering numerous
methods for accessing geospatial data within this database. To find all
methods suitable for working with points in a two-dimensional space, we
can execute the following query:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/kloba/fc87c4192c371f543a811691c6ea921c.js"></script>

As a result, we will observe at least five access methods, including
btree, hash, gist, brin, and spgist. I suggest investigating by creating
indexes for each of these methods and operator classes. After creating
the indexes, we will assess the query performance regarding fires at
military facilities in russia to determine which methods are most
effective for our task.

  | Index type | Index operator class               | Filtering operator       | Index creation time | Index size | Query execution time | Brief explanation                                                                                              |
|------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| btree      | btree_geometry_ops                 | There is no corresponding operator---the index is disregarded for this query. | 1 sec 918 ms | 81 MB   | 53 min 45 sec (129 rows affected) | Supports equality and range queries; retrieves data quickly and in an organized manner.                      |
| hash       | hash_geometry_ops                  | There is no corresponding operator---the index is disregarded for this query. | 3 secs 158 ms | 59 MB   | 53 min 15 sec (129 rows affected) | Fast equality search; not suitable for ordering or range queries.                                             |
| brin       | brin_geometry_inclusion_ops_2d     | @(geometry,geometry)     | 536 ms              | 0.032 MB  | 28 min 3 sec (129 rows affected)   | Effective for large datasets with naturally ordered data; indexes block ranges rather than individual rows. |
| gist       | gist_geometry_ops_2d               | @(geometry,geometry)     | 11 secs 659 ms      | 94 MB     | 493 ms (129 rows affected)         | Supports a wide range of queries, including spatial searches for overlap and proximity.                      |
| spgist     | spgist_geometry_ops_2d             | @(geometry,geometry)     | 6 secs 290 ms       | 78 MB     | 353 ms (129 rows affected)         | Suitable for data with uneven distribution; supports a variety of split tree structures.                     |
| gist       | point_ops                          | <@(point,polygon)        | 1 secs 426 ms       | 81 MB     | 306 ms (returned 132 records)      | Perfect for point data; supports queries on spatial relationships, such as containment and intersection.    |
| spgist     | quad_point_ops                     | <@(point,box)            | 4 secs 849 ms       | 77 MB     | 243 ms (173 rows affected)         | Utilizes quadtrees to index point data; effective in specific scenarios of spatial analysis.                 |
| spgist     | kd_point_ops                       | <@(point,box)            | 5 secs 204 ms       | 93 MB     | 199 ms (173 rows affected)         | Employs kd-trees for multidimensional point data; excellent for finding nearest neighbors.                   |

_Note: The operator classes mentioned do not utilize geometry data types for searching; they work with <@(point, polygon) and <@(point, box). As a result, the row counts may not match the output (for example, a complex geographic polygon may have been simplified to a rectangle)._

The results table shows that the most effective indexes for our task are
[GiST](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/gist.html) and
[SP-GiST](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/spgist.html). Let\'s
delve into how they operate.

## How GiST works 

Generalized Search Tree (GiST) indexes in PostgreSQL enable efficient
sorting and searching across diverse data types using the concept of
balanced trees. They provide the ability to develop custom operators for
indexing, making GiST quite versatile and adaptive to specific
requirements.

![](/imgs/geoanalytics-postgresql/image6.png)
_The hierarchical structure of the GiST index in PostgreSQL \[1\]_

In the example of a GiST tree depicted: at the top level, there are
**R1** and **R2**, serving as bounding boxes for other elements. **R1**
contains **R3**, **R4**, and **R5**, while **R3**, in turn, encompasses
**R8**, **R9**, and **R10**. The GiST index has a hierarchical
structure, allowing for significantly faster search. Unlike B-trees,
GiST supports overlap operations and spatial relationship determination.
This is why GiST is well-suited for indexing geometric data.

## How SP-GiST works 

Space Partitioning Generalized Search Tree (SP-GiST) indexes in
PostgreSQL are designed for data structures that partition space into
non-overlapping regions, such as quadrant trees or prefix trees. They
enable the recursive division of data into subsets, forming unbalanced
trees. This makes SP-GiST indexes particularly effective for in-memory
usage, where they can quickly process queries due to fewer levels and
small data groups in each node.

However, SP-GiST indexes have disadvantages when stored on disk due to
the high number of disk operations required for their functioning,
especially in large databases.

Considering this, GiST indexes often become a better choice, especially
when working with polygons and complex spatial structures.

## Finding the nearest neighbors: 10 fires near the Shahed production plant 

Now, let\'s attempt to solve the task of finding nearest neighbors using
PostgreSQL. Using our datasets, we will try to identify ten fires that
occurred near the factory in russia, where Iranian Shahed drones are
manufactured. For more detailed information about the plant, you can
refer to the [research](https://molfar.com/blog/alabuga-deanon)
conducted by the Molfar team. The factory is located in the special
economic zone
[Alabuga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabuga_Special_Economic_Zone)
in Tatarstan, where previously cat food and automotive glass were
produced, and mushrooms were grown. However, after sanctions against
Russia, its priorities shifted, and now it plays a key role in russia\'s
plans for drone production.

One of the methods to solve this task is to create a buffer in the form
of a circle around the selected target. This buffer is recursively
expanded until the required number of results is obtained. In
PostgreSQL, this can be implemented with the following SQL query, which
forms the buffer and identifies fires that occurred within the specified
radius from the selected object:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/kloba/44b4f72ebbf45f8e3babd82ef2f04e14.js"></script>

This approach involves gradually expanding the buffer and analyzing the
results, which can be time-consuming.

![](/imgs/geoanalytics-postgresql/image7.png)
_A plant in Tatarstan that produces Shaheds with fire visualization
within radii of 1.5 and 10 km_

Various operators supported by GiST indexes can be utilized to optimize
geospatial queries. To retrieve a list of available operators to use
with a GiST index, you can execute an SQL query that scans the
PostgreSQL system tables and provides information about operators
associated with the **gist_geometry_ops_2d** operator class. This will
help identify the most efficient operators for performing specific
geospatial operations in the database.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/kloba/99d7f600c728f184d412d77ce8028fb4.js"></script>

Our GiST index provides extensive capabilities for working with geodata,
allowing you to determine the spatial location of objects and measure
distances. The **\<-\>** operator enables sorting objects by proximity
to a specified point. In this example, we use this operator to identify
the ten closest fires to the specified location.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/kloba/b3ac9dab240ca834cf20b61016f0da3e.js"></script>

The query turned out to be significantly faster---15 times swifter,
compared to the previous methodology, and this is without repeated
executions with a changed radius. We can analyze the query plan to
confirm that the speed increased due to the use of an index and an
operator. This way, we\'ll ensure that the index was indeed involved,
which is the key to improving productivity.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/kloba/f6be940d206e4a453ce58f572f0559f3.js"></script>

As we can see, indexes, similar to GiST, extend analytical capabilities
beyond simple comparisons, enabling the resolution of more complex
tasks. As demonstrated in this article, open data can be effectively
utilized for quickly assessing and defining goals on a global scale,
including evaluating the success of target impact.

## Uber\'s H3: a perspective on geospatial analytics and data aggregation {#ubers-h3-a-perspective-on-geospatial-analytics-and-data-aggregation .list-paragraph}

The H3, developed by Uber, is a hexagonal grid system designed to
facilitate flexible and efficient distribution of geospatial data. It
seems that H3 has the potential to become a common standard for working
with geodata in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Let\'s explore how this
tool can be used for data aggregation and solving complex geoanalytical
tasks.

![](/imgs/geoanalytics-postgresql/image8.png)
_Illustration of the Uber H3 hexagonal grid_

As you can see in the image, each hexagon serves as a distinct
geographic unit, simplifying the processing of intricate geoforms into
uniform segments.

| Level | Total number of objects | Number of hexagons | Number of pentagons |
|-------|-------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| 0     | 122                     | 110                | 12                  |

| 4     | 288,122                 | 288,110            | 12                  |

| 8     | 691,776,122             | 691,776,110        | 12                  |
| 9     | 4,842,432,842           | 4,842,432,830      | 12                  |
| 10    | 33,897,029,882          | 33,897,029,870     | 12                  |
| 11    | 237,279,209,162         | 237,279,209,150    | 12                  |
| 12    | 1,660,954,464,122       | 1,660,954,464,110  | 12                  |
| 13    | 11,626,681,248,842      | 11,626,681,248,830 | 12                  |
| 14    | 81,386,768,741,882      | 81,386,768,741,870 | 12                  |

This is a hierarchical system consisting of 15 levels dividing the
Earth\'s surface into hexagons. The zero level is divided into 122
sections, 12 of which are pentagons for accurately representing the
Earth\'s spherical shape. We have approximately 569 trillion hexagons at
the finest level, each representing a distinct geospatial object. The
video below demonstrates how this works in practice.
<https://youtu.be/RbeYPqsFGPI>

PostgreSQL can integrate H3 functionality through an additional
extension. To install this extension, use the **CREATE EXTENSION h3;**
command, and it is available on cloud computing services, including AWS
RDS (my acknowledgments to AWS for their support of Ukraine). Once
you\'ve installed this extension, new functions become accessible.
Let\'s explore those functions that might be useful for beginners:

| Function             | Input data                           | Output data                          | Description                                                                                      |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| h3_lat_lng_to_cell   | latitude: FLOAT, longitude: FLOAT, resolution: INT | H3 index: BIGINT                     | Converts latitude and longitude coordinates into an H3 index at a specified resolution level.  |
| h3_cell_to_boundary  | H3 index: BIGINT                     | Array of boundary coordinates: GEOMETRY(POLYGON, 4326) | Transforms an H3 index into a geometric polygon representing the boundaries of a hexagon.     |
| h3_get_resolution    | H3 index: BIGINT                     | Resolution level: INT                | Returns the resolution level of a given H3 index.                                               |
| h3_cell_to_parent    | H3 index: BIGINT, desired resolution: INT | Parent H3 index: BIGINT              | Converts an H3 index into its parent index at a higher hierarchy level.                         |
| h3_cell_to_children  | H3 index: BIGINT, desired resolution: INT | Array of child H3 indexes: SETOF BIGINT | Converts an H3 index into an array of child indices at a lower hierarchy level.               |
| h3_polygon_to_cells  | geometry: GEOMETRY, resolution: INT  | Array of H3 indexes: SETOF BIGINT    | Transforms a polygon into a set of H3 indices that fully or partially cover the polygon.       |
| h3_grid_disk         | H3 index: BIGINT, range: INT         | Array of H3 indexes: SETOF BIGINT    | Generates an array of H3 indices representing a hexagonal grid around the central H3 index, forming a "disk" of a defined radius. |
| h3_compact_cells     | Array of H3 indexes: SETOF BIGINT    | Array of compact H3 indexes: SETOF BIGINT | Consolidates an array of H3 indices, reducing the number of indices covering the same area.   |


To address the first task effectively, we can transform all our polygons
into arrays of H3 indexes (hexagons) of a specified level. Similarly, we
can process the centroids of fires by converting them into H3 indexes.
By obtaining BIGINT data types for these H3 indexes, we can apply a
standard B-tree index, which is particularly efficient in performing
equality comparison operations. This will significantly improve query
execution speed in complex geoanalysis tasks, ensuring fast and accurate
results.

Let\'s examine a few simple H3 functions that will help better
understand how this works in practice:

| **h3_polygon_to_cells(geom, 8)**<br>This function converts the geometry of a military polygon into a set of H3 indexes at the eighth level of resolution, effectively dividing the polygon into hexagons, each covering an area of 0.737327598 square kilometers, enabling detailed spatial analysis. | **h3_grid_disk(h3_polygon_to_cells(geom, 8), 1)**<br>If certain areas of the polygon remain uncovered after applying h3_polygon_to_cells, you can use h3_grid_disk to create an additional ring of H3 indexes. It will expand coverage by adding hexagons around existing indexes, ensuring complete coverage of the defined geographic polygon. | **h3_polygon_to_cells(geom, 9)**<br>Using the **h3_polygon_to_cells** function with a level 9 increases the grid's resolution to a finer scale, where each hexagon represents an area of 0.105332513 square kilometers. This allows for greater accuracy in reproducing the geometry of the geographic polygon for detailed spatial analysis. However, it also results in more hexagons, which may negatively impact query execution speed. |

During my presentation at PGConf.2023, the largest conference in Europe
dedicated to PostgreSQL, I had the opportunity to showcase a series of
more complex challenges that can be addressed by aggregating geospatial
data using H3. One example involved the search for other drones located
in the exact location and time, as well as the analysis of routes taken
by drones traveling together, identified in different places over a
specific period (Companion Analysis). You will have the opportunity to
learn more about this topic in the continuation of this article. In the
meantime, you can check out the materials of my
[presentation](https://klioba.com/public/presentations/PostGIS_Warfare_Export.pdf).

Within our datasets, we can analyze military objects and, through
aggregation with H3, calculate the density of these objects in russia.
The visualization of this analysis looks like this:

temporarily occupied Autonomous Republic of Crimea using H3 hexagons

Using H3 for aggregating geospatial data significantly enhances
analytical capabilities, allowing for a more profound interpretation and
visualization of complex spatial relationships.

## Concluding remarks

If you are a representative of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and are
seeking qualified support in the field of data, Big Data, or
geoanalytics, feel free to reach out to me. My team of volunteers and I
will gladly assist you with our knowledge and resources.
